### Description ###
This program provides desktop computer users with an easy-to-use graphical interface to create/decode qrcode images using the renowned zxing barcode library. It resembles the [online qrcode creator](http://zxing.appspot.com/generator/) from the zxing project, but can also decode qrcode from screen capture.

Please see the [Changelog](http://code.google.com/p/qrcode-desktop/wiki/Changelog) for changes between versions.
